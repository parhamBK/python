## üìù About This Project

This is a simple educational code to help you get comfortable with Python and basic coding concepts.  
There is no serious purpose behind it ‚Äî just a hands-on way to practice.

The code is not written in a perfect or optimized way. As ideas came to mind, I added new functions freely.  
This is one of my first experiences building a complete Python project, and I enjoyed experimenting with it.

Also, this program is designed to be very flexible:  
No matter how the user writes the symptoms ‚Äî connected words, extra characters, full sentences ‚Äî  
it will try to intelligently extract valid medical symptoms from the input.
